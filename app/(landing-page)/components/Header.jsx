            This is the teaching portal for{" "}
            <a href="https://tylerpaige.com" className="underline">Tyler Paige</a>. I will list all of
            my teaching materials here, like syllabi, workshops, and lectures.

            The throughline between my teaching and my creative practice is to
            find useful disorientations: misheard phrases that spark interest;
            quick glances at the clock when a second feels strangely longer;
            sudden vividness when a truism feels deep. Therefore, the name here
            is taken from a rehabilitation center seen driving 65mph down the
            Garden State Parkwayâ€”the center between dizziness and balance.
